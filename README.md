Create your layouts without polluting your HTML
-----------------------------------------------

I've never liked the theory of having to add a class of 'span-5' or similar to my html as I qualify that is presentational markup.

Using SaSS, I've created a responsive grid system, at the moment based around a WordPress theme that moves all of this styling back into the CSS where it belongs.
